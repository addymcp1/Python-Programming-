## Python Programming in Windows ##
---
New to programming? Need a little hunch to kickstart? Then this is it. Python can be easy picked up if you're a newbie or you're experienced with other programming languages.
So let's dive in. :smile:
### **1. Installation** ###
Some Windows computers (notably those from HP) now come with Python pre-installed in them. Therefore first make sure if it's preinstalled or not by entering **Python** in a 
command line. 

If it's not, Go to this [Python Downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) for Windows and download the most stable versions of Python 3 and Python 2 which is seen via 
the _yellow buttons_.

### 2. Learning Python ###
If you've never programmed before you may need to go through some sites that offer in-browser coding for those who want to learn Python like
[CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python).
When you're all set to code, you'll need a text editor or IDE.Text editors and integrated development environments (IDEs) are applications 
for writing code. These applications are the primary user interface for developers to create their own programs.

For now you can use [IDLE](https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html), which is bundled with Python and supports extensions or
[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3), which has slick user interface along with its numerous extensions for syntax highlighting, source file finding and analyzing code metrics.

### 3. Compiling and Execution ###
